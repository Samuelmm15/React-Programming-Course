# 32 lesson Notes

At this lesson, we are going to create a 404 page that will be displayed when a user tries to access a page that does not exist.

## **NOTE**

At this time we are going to display the 404 page at the backen of the application, not at the frontend of the application.

To take a 404 error, we need to code the try-except block at the backed because, if we are going to add this error at the backend, first we need to create this error and coded at the backed of the application.

At the final of the lesson, we create a general JavaScript file that is called `shared.js` and it contains the different urls that we are going to use in the application.
