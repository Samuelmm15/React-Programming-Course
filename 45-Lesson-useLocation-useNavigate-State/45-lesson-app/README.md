# 45 lesson Notes

At this lesson, we are going to learn the useLocation hook.

## useLocation

The useLocation hook returns the location object that represents the current URL. It is similar to the one that we get from the render props of the Route component.

We are going to use it to navigate to the page that we came from when we login into the page.
