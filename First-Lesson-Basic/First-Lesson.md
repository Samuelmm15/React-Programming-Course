[React website](https://reactjs.org/).

## How to generate a React page ?

There is a terminal aplication that permits to generate a React page. The aplication is called `create-react-app`. 
To install it, you have to write the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ npx
```

This npx is a `node.js` application, that can make many options with this.

To create a React page, you have to write the following command:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-app-name
```

This command will create a folder with the name of the page. In this case, the folder will be called `my-app-name`.
The principal code implementation will be at the folder called `src`.

## How to run a React page ?

To run a React page, you have to write the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command will run the React page in the browser. At the `README.md` file, there will be the different commands
that you can use to run the React page. For example:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run build
$ npm run eject
```

## Using React at the aplication

At the public folder, there is a file called `index.html`. This file is the principal file of the application.
That file contains the metadata of the application. This file, doesn't have the principal code of the application.
The principal code of the application is at the `src` folder. At the `src` folder, there is a file called `index.js`.

At the `index.js` file, there is a div with the id `root`. This div is the principal div of the application. This div
is the principal div of the application because, all the code of the application will be at this div.

At the `index.js` file, there is a line of code that imports the `App.js` file. This file is the principal file of the
application. This file contains the principal code of the application. So, the principal code implementation there will
be at the `App.js` file.
