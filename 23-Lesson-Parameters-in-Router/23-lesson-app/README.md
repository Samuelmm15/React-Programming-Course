# Twenty two lesson Notes

At this lesson, we are going to add an Api to our application. We are going to use a free  Api called free dictionary api. To use this api
into our application, we need to use `Fetch API` to make a request to the api and get the response. We are going to use `async` and `await` to make our code more readable.
