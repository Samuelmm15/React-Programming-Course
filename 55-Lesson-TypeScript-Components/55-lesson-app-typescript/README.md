# 54 Lesson

At this lesson we are going to start a new project that use typescript in it.

At this lesson, we are going to edit the files called `App.tsx

## `Axios`

Axios it's a client HTTP that us promises to run. So, we need to use this with typeScript, because at this
language we can use promises in it.

The axios website is [Axios](https://axios-http.com/es/).

`IMPORTANT`:
At the start axios is not installed already, so we need to install into the terminal.

```bash
npm install axios
```
