# 57 Lesson

At this lesson we are going to create a graph that the user can see the progress of the crypto coins, so
we need to create the granph and a dropdown that can give to the user to select an option to show to the
user.

At this lesson, we are going to edit the files called `App.tsx`


## Installation of Chart.js

At first, we need to install the package at npm called Chart.js. So the command is:

```bash
npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
```

We can see some examples of the use of this package at the website at this [link](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/examples)

## Installation of Moment

This library contains the different implementation of the dropdown menu that changes the time of the chart.

To install moment:

```bash
npm install moment
```
