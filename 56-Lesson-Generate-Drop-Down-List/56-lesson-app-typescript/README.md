# 55 Lesson

At this lesson we are going to add components to our app using typescript.

At this lesson, we are going to edit the files called `App.tsx`

`IMPORTANT`:
we can see the important information to use typeScript and React, we can see it into the next website:
[typescript-cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app).

## `useState` using TypeScript

When we use useState using typeScript the style of using this is similar to the example that you can see
below:

```typescript
import {useState} from "react";

const [example, setExample] = useState<Example | null>(null);
```

So now, we are going to use `Function components` at this 55 lesson of the React Course.
