# Eight Lesson Notes

At this lesson we are going to learn how to implement different employees. So at first we are going to create a variable
with the characteristics of the employee, and then we are using a loop to display the different employees that are in
the company for example.

## How to obtain a image of the Pexels page

To use a Pexel image on our page we need to search for the image that we want to use, and then we need to click on
the image and then click to copy the image URL. After that we need to paste the image URL in our code.

## How to stablish a identificator to the employee

To stablish a identificator to the employee we need a library called UUID. This library is going to generate a random
number that is going to be the identificator of the employee. To install this library we need to write in the terminal
`npm install uuid` and then we need to import the library in our code with `import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';`.
