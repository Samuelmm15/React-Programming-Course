# 49 lesson Notes

At this lesson, we are going to add a user register form and API to our project.

At first, we are going to add some aspects to the backend of our application, and then we are going to add a user register form to our frontend.

## Backend

First we create a new url called `api/register` and then we create a new view called `RegisterView` and then we add this view to the `urls.py` file.
