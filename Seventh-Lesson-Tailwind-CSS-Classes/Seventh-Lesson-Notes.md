# Seven lesson Notes

To use the different components of the TailwindCSS we can use the documentation implemented at the official page 
of the TailwindCSS, the are some examples of code of the different components that has this framework.

## Examples of ClassNames that are important to use at TailwindCSS

For example, if you want to use different cards that are dynamic, you can use the className: `flex flex-col` to create a 
card that is dynamic, and you can use the className: `flex flex-row` to create a card that is dynamic too. Or you can use
the className: `flex flex-col-reverse` to create a card that is dynamic too, and you can use the className:
`flex flex-row-reverse` to create a card that is dynamic too. Or you can use the className: `flex flex-wrap` to create a
card that is dynamic too, and you can use the className: `flex flex-wrap-reverse` to create a card that is dynamic too.

There is another example of important className, if you want to add some `margin` into the different components of your 
page, you can use the className: `m-0` to add a margin of 0px, and you can use the className: `m-1` to add a margin of
4px, and you can use the className: `m-2` to add a margin of 8px, etc.
