# 29 lesson Notes

At this lesson, we are going to learn how to create a REST API using Django REST Framework.

At the first time, we need to create a .gitignore into de project folder of the backend, because we don't want to upload the virtual environment and the database to the repository. 
We need to add the important files, so we are going to create a .gitignore file and add the template from internet.

To obtain an example of gitignore templates we can go to [toptal-page](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) to generate an example of gitignore file.
