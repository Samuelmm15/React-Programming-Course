## useState Hook

- useState is a hook that allows us to use state in a functional component.
- useState returns an array with two values.
  - The first value is the current state.
  - The second value is a function that allows us to update the state.
  - The function that allows us to update the state is called a setter function.
  - The setter function takes in a new value and updates the state with that new value.
  - The setter function is called with the new value as an argument.
