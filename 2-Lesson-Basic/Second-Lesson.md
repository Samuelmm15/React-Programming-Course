## How to execute a react app

To execute a React app, you need to execute the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

These command will execute the app in the development mode, on the local host, but
there is a problem with it, so, to execute the app in the production mode, you
need to execute the following command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Then you need to execute the following command:

```bash
$ serve -s build
```

This command makes the app into a link, so this link is functional.
